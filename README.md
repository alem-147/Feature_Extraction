---

Area
- uses skimage reigon props to get the area of the threshold images on each class

---

Perimiter
- uses skimage reigon props to get the perimeter of the threshold images on each class

---

Centroid
- uses skimage reigon props to get the centroid of the threshold images on each class

---

Euclidian distance
- takes the euclidian distance from each pixel value to the average pixel for a given class

---

Edge detection
